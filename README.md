# Portfolio Sketlon Project Documentation

In this project I created a mobile version of a Portfolio integrating some features:
- A header with navigation bar and menu including a logo.
- A Presentation section that provides general informations for the portfolio's owner.
- A section to show the projects created by the portfolio's owner.
- An about me section.
- Links to social networks accounts.
